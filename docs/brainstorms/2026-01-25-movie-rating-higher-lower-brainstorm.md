# Movie Rating Higher/Lower Game

## What We're Building
Create a simple web game where players see two movie cards and choose which has the higher IMDb rating. The experience prioritizes quick, casual play with low friction and immediate feedback. Players choose a 5 or 10 round session, earn points with streak bonuses, and keep playing even if they miss (streak resets, session continues). Rounds are untimed, and the final score is shareable as an image card.

The movie set focuses on the IMDb Top 250 overall, with each card showing only the poster and title to keep rounds fast. After each guess, reveal the two ratings (numbers only) so players can learn and move on quickly. No content filters are planned for v1.

## Why This Approach
The Quick Sessions approach best matches the goal of a lightweight game that feels fun in 1-2 minutes and produces shareable scores. It keeps the core loop tight and avoids extra structure that would slow down first launch.

We considered a Daily Challenge for retention and a Party Mix for social play, but both add scheduling or multiplayer expectations that are not required for the first version. A straightforward higher/lower loop is enough to validate the idea and build a solid base.

## Key Decisions
- Experience: quick casual fun with minimal friction
- Core mechanic: higher/lower IMDb rating
- Movie set: IMDb Top 250 overall
- Session style: 5 or 10 rounds
- Scoring: points plus streaks
- Mistakes: continue play, reset streak
- Timing: untimed rounds
- Card info: poster and title only
- Reveal: ratings only
- Sharing: image card with score and session length
- Share image style: cinematic poster
- Content filters: none for v1
- Success criteria: shareable scores
